<p>To operate the system, the hardware device should have access to the internet. Once that is established, the user may login to the system, which is only possible if the user has registered themselves to the system. The user role governs how one interacts with the system.</p>

<p>If the user logs in as a farmer, then they will be restricted to the farmerâ€™s roles. As a farmer in the system, one inputs records about their farm. The user registers an item into the system as a budget item, allowing it to be used. Afterwards, the farmer may add crops or livestock to the system, acting as a registry for the available crops or livestock at the farm. Adding crops or livestock will deduct from the budget based on their purchase price.</p>

    <p>With the added crops, the farmer may perform operations on them in correlation with real-time events happening on the farm. The farmer can harvest, fertilize, and treat these crops. Similarly, with the added livestock, the farmer can record the returns on produce, the feed for the livestock, and the treatment used on the animals. The software generates reports based on these records.</p>

    <p>If a user logs in as an administrator, their roles are different. An administrator can add or register other administrators to introduce new administrators into the system. Apart from that, the administrator can register users, delete users, and update users.</p>
